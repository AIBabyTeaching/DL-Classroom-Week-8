# DL-Classroom-Week-8
Build CNN from scratch
And use Pretrained model too to compare your results

The dataset is gathered through kaggle api competition: dogs-vs-cats
First run the dataset_api_kaggle.ipynb using mine or your API token (I shared my API token on kaggle.json)
kaggle.json should be place in the folder where the codes are resident.
After running the dataset_api_kaggle.ipynb, go and run the Training a convnet from scratch on a small dataset.ipynb.
